# Query Fan-out (QFO) System Integration

## Overview

The Query Fan-out (QFO) system has been successfully integrated into your Brief AI application, providing advanced query expansion and parallel analysis capabilities. This system automatically expands a single search query into multiple related queries and executes them in parallel for comprehensive data gathering.

## What is Query Fan-out?

Query Fan-out is a sophisticated system that:

1. **Expands Primary Queries**: Takes a single topic/keyword and generates multiple related queries
2. **Parallel Execution**: Runs multiple queries simultaneously for efficiency
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Aggregates results from different query types
4. **Intelligent Insights**: Provides strategic recommendations based on query performance

## Key Features

### 1. Query Expansion Types

- **Primary Queries**: Original search term
- **Semantic Variants**: AI-generated related concepts and synonyms
- **Long-tail Keywords**: Extended, specific search phrases
- **Competitor Analysis**: Queries targeting specific competitor domains

### 2. Parallel Processing

- **Batch Processing**: Executes queries in controlled batches (3 at a time)
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API rate limits with intelligent delays
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when individual queries fail
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks execution time and success rates

### 3. Intelligent Insights

- **Content Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing content opportunities
- **Query Performance Metrics**: Analyzes success rates by query type
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Provides content strategy suggestions
- **Competitive Advantages**: Highlights unique positioning opportunities

## How It Works

### Step 1: Query Expansion
```
Primary Query: "dijital pazarlama"
↓
Expanded Queries:
- "dijital pazarlama nasıl"
- "dijital pazarlama nedir"
- "dijital pazarlama rehberi"
- "dijital pazarlama 2024"
- "dijital pazarlama Türkiye"
```

### Step 2: Parallel Execution
- Queries are executed in parallel batches
- Each query type uses optimized strategies
- Results are collected and deduplicated

### Step 3: Analysis & Aggregation
- Performance metrics are calculated
- Content gaps are identified
- Strategic insights are generated
- Results are integrated with AI analysis

## Configuration Options

### Query Fan-out Settings
```typescript
const options = {
  maxQueries: 8,                    // Maximum number of queries to execute
  includeSemantic: true,            // Generate semantic variants
  includeLongTail: true,            // Generate long-tail keywords
  includeCompetitorAnalysis: true   // Include competitor-specific queries
};
```

### Performance Tuning
- **Batch Size**: 3 queries per batch (configurable)
- **Rate Limiting**: 1 second delay between batches
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per query execution
- **Fallback**: Automatic fallback for failed queries
